## MongoDB Lab

For this lab, I made a very simple program that counts the amount of times you press the spacebar within 10 seconds. The score is appended to a MongoDB database.

Running this program should be straightforward. MongoDB automatically creates the database and collection if they are not already created. These are created inside of the `MongoConnection` class.

As long as you have MongoDB installed and configured on **Port 27017**, the program should configure everything for you and not require any additional steps.

Run the `Game` class and try to beat my high score!
